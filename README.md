# recipe_app
This app helps you discover new recipes according to what is at your disposal.
Also allows you to track your pantry/fridge and allows you to chat with an expert
AI chef at all times

Fixed the login issue by making session_cookie_secure = True

Tested APIs using Postman and ensured proper data storage and transfer using 
pgAdmin4

I am using the openAI API for the chefai feature

For the recipe search, I will be using the free tier of the spoonacular api. 
With this API, I could potentially also add new featues to this app in the future
like a nutrition feature
